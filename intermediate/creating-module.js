              How to create a model
================================================================================
We do that by creating a class and a class construtor function then extend it
- Create a folder called models.
- Inside the models folder craete a flle called car.js - for example
- Then create another file called index.js - this is the file where we will extentate the model to and use it.
- In the car.js file, create a class and export it.
- In the index.js import the 'Car' class, with that we have access to the class defined, hence we can use it
